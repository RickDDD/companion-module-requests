# Companion Module Requests
Got a request for a piece of gear, device, hardware or software you'd like to be able control with Companion?

[Request it here.](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-requests/issues/new)

**Please include with your request:**
* The name of the device, hardware, or software you would like to control.
* What you would like to be able to make it do from Companion.
* Direct links or attachments to the ethernet control protocol or API. Without this, it can be very difficult, *and in some cases, impossible* to fulfill your request. Module requests that do not come with protocol information may be deleted.

**Guidelines:**
* Commit to being a tester for the module you requested. Make sure you are subscribed to notifications to your request with a method you will check up on.
* If a developer asks a question about your request, provide feedback promptly. Be thorough in your responses.
* Remember, everyone working on this project is donating their time. Please be courteous and respectful.
* If your request has a tight timeline, consider offering a financial reward to speed up development of your module request.
* Consider other ways you can serve the community and project here, like verifying and submitting thorough bug reports, creating documentation, and helping others along the way.
